PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
Software Engineer with a B.S. in Computer Science and Technology and three years of experience supporting, refactoring, and developing highly regulated, mission-critical backend systems. His approach blends product-focused engineering with Cloud, DevOps, and Application Delivery practices, driving resilience, automation, and secure, observable platforms through CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, and modern monitoring solutions.

Worked at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMC), where one of his major achievements was upgrading and refactoring backend services using Java and Spring Boot, managing integrations involving containers and cloud-based services to align economic calculations and reduce cognitive complexity. He also redesigned and automated regulatory ETL pipelines with Pentaho, improving data accuracy, release traceability, and timeliness to proactively prevent regulatory fines and enhance operational efficiency.

In addition to his engineering experience, he is passionate about sharing technical knowledge and simplifying complex cloud, backend, and distributed systems concepts. He creates clear and practical technical content, including internal documentation, troubleshooting guides, reproducible examples, and architecture explanations, and enjoys teaching, mentoring, and presenting technical ideas in accessible ways. He thrives in roles that combine deep engineering work with developer enablement, communication, and content creation.

Key strengths include:
    • Support, maintenance, and modernization of highly regulated and mission-critical backend systems.
    • Refactoring, support, and impactful design of ETL pipelines with compliance and delivery governance in mind.
    • Active use of CI/CD automation, secure credential/certificate management and multi-cluster deployment of containerized applications to Kubernetes.
    • Comprehensive debugging, release validation, and post-deployment monitoring using logs, database tracing, and observability platforms (Splunk, Grafana, Prometheus, Kubernetes).
    • Collaboration with DevOps and infrastructure teams to ensure stable, auditable, and compliant software delivery.
    • Ability to translate complex distributed systems, cloud architectures, and debugging workflows into accessible explanations for diverse audiences, from junior developers to cross-functional stakeholders.
    • Experience producing internal technical documentation, operational runbooks, and reproducible technical examples that function as educational material for engineering teams.

He is known for structured thinking, technical ownership, clear communication, and adaptability. He enjoys optimizing workflows, collaborating across teams, embracing each challenge as an opportunity to learn, and is passionate about building systems that scale cleanly and perform reliably, ensuring seamless application delivery from well-tested code to monitoring, automated deployments, and regulatory compliance.

Title: Software Engineer II – Application Delivery (L2/L3 Support & Development)
Dates: Feb 2025 – Jul 2025
Supported, maintained, and modernized backend services for accounting and post-trade transaction processing across LATAM markets within the Application Delivery organization. Combined L2/L3 production support with secure and compliant system maintenance throughout the full software delivery life-cycle in a highly regulated environment.
    • Maintained and integrated Java/Spring Boot services on Kubernetes-based platforms as part of the Repo Harmonization initiative, enabling Back Office system to process UGM/UVM message formats from Front Office application. Validated and persisted valuation data to ensure consistency across Front- and Back-Office operations, removing redundant economic calculations and improving accuracy in post-trade reporting.
    • Led the renewal and rotation of digital certificates and credentials used for Post-Trade System communication with SPEI, SPT, and an international risk platform, coordinating deployments, validating secure message exchange, and ensuring uninterrupted operations and compliance with financial security standards, preventing downtime across multi-region post-trade integrations.
    • Ensured post-deployment validation for automated release pipelines using Jules and Bitbucket, verifying service integrity and inter-system connectivity after certificate renewals and environment updates.
    • Applied Test-Driven Development (TDD) with JUnit and Mockito, and enforced internal security and code-quality standards through SonarQube, contributing to secure software delivery in regulated contexts.
    • Collaborated with DevOps and infrastructure teams to maintain auditable and reliable production environments, aligning operational changes with compliance and governance policies.
    • Monitored services and investigated production incidents using Splunk, performing root-cause analysis and implementing configuration or code fixes to improve resilience and observability.
    • Created internal documentation, architecture notes, and troubleshooting guides that helped developers understand system behavior, Kubernetes deployments, certificate workflows, and integration patterns.
    • Delivered knowledge-sharing sessions and walkthroughs to support teams and new engineers, simplifying complex post-trade workflows and distributed debugging processes.
